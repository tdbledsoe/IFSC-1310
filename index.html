    <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
    <p>Reading over the article on Progressive Enhancement it shows how creating a strong foundation that everyone can access is key to ensuring everyone has access to the content. The old idea of Graceful Degradation limits individuals who might not be able to run the newest frameworks and limits their access to content. The idea of creating a strong foundation not only helps the user but also the developer for longevity. Moving away from Graceful Degradation will help ensure all users have accessibility and will make it so the developer does not have to come back and make contistent updates. While the Progressive Enhancement model does require more forethought it, ensuring the user has at least access to the content should be the end goal. More information can be found at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">freeCodeCamp</a> where they explain in more detail the pros of the Progressive Enhancement model and how the Graceful Degradation is obsolete.</p>

    <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
    <p> I asked my spouse and father in-law to give me feedback on what they thought of my initial SpaceX webpages. While most of the feedback was positive they brought to my attetion a few stand outs. The first which I knew had to go was the plain background. While at first this sounded like a good idea to me have a black background since it kind of mimicked space, it just didn't bring the page to life so I opted for a more space theme which I believe tied together well. My father in-law brought up text size, I could see how this could be a problem for old any young as making the text just a little larger, made it easy on the eyes. I orginally had a picture next to the introduction of the Dragon spacecraft, but all agreed it cluttered the paragraph so I removed it. I chose a black background with no border for the configuartions as it blended well and seemed to flow well too. I tried editing the contacts page myself with the HTML code and changing the CSS but everytime I would fix a problem I enduced another. While I eventually got it to a point where I didn't hate it, the perfectionism in me still didn't enjoy the overall page. Some of the HTML code they used I had to look up and still couldn't find exact ways on how to adjust it in the manner I wanted, but it was usable. I tried messing around with JavaScript but definitely need to learn more so I am able to understand the changes, after messing around with it for awhile I just went with the example utilized in class as I was spending too much time trying to figure out the concept and was making matters worse and did not want to ruin my page. I will go back once the semster is over and play around with diffent modes for slick.</p>
